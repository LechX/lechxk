  <h1 class="profileTitle">Lech rhymes with tech.</h1>
  <p class="profileBlurb">There's more to my story than that, but you have to start somewhere. Some things to know about me: a high school classmate's father referred to me as "Lech the resourceful"; I get excited about efficiency, problem-solving, and ideas with potential; and I'm very interested in technology that gets people to engage with the outside world.</p>
  <h3 class="profileTitle">Interests</h3>
  <p class="profileBlurb">I'm addicted to DuoLingo. Currently over 35% fluent in German after struggling to hit 10% in French. I love soccer. I try to play at least twice a week and have done some coaching. I also love to read, especially contemporary fiction, although I have recently discovered some joy in non-fiction (possibly related to switching from economics textbooks to coding manuals). I also like to design and build things in my spare time, from furniture and apparel to websites and apps.</p>
  <h3 class="profileTitle">Formal Education</h3>
  <p class="profileBlurb">I was Montessori-educated through 8th grade. Still a big believer in prepared environments and carrying chairs the proper way. I was in the first graduating class at my high school (go Knights!), where the work-study program prepared me for life at a startup. I went to Pomona College, happiest place on earth. I'm currently enrolled at PDX Code Guild, honing my Python and various other computer languages.</p>
  <h3 class="profileTitle">Major Employers</h3>
  <p class="profileBlurb">Most recently, I helped build Shift Technologies, an online automotive marketplace, from 10 to 300 employees. My primary responsibility was developing the core vehicle valuation products and processes (appraisal and retail), but wore as many hats as necessary to drive growth. Prior to that, I worked at Bain &amp; Co., consulting on revenue-generation, cost-reduction, and private equity diligence projects in a variety of industries, including healthcare, consumer products, utilities, retail, and technology. I started my career at a metals recycler, Schnitzer, working on projects in strategy, analytics, investor relations, and directing philanthropic efforts.</p>
  <h3 class="profileTitle">Lived Locations</h3>
  <p class="profileBlurb">I grew up in Portland, Oregon, and keep coming back. I spent a summer in Cincinnati, mostly pipetting, back when I seriously thought, "I want to be a doctor when I grew up." I studied abroad in Freiburg and have a strong feeling that I'll return to Germany at some point. I lived in San Francisco way, way after it was cool. I lived for a short time in the country of Georgia, the most hospitable place I have had the pleasure of visiting.</p>
